## Overview

**Teia UI** is the frontend codebase powering [Teia](https://teia.art), an open, community-owned NFT platform built on the Tezos blockchain. It offers a decentralized, sustainable, and equitable marketplace for digital artists and collectors.

Teia is a **community-driven fork** of the pioneering Tezos NFT platform [Hic et Nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/). The project focuses on accessibility, sustainability, and decentralization to empower users worldwide with full ownership and control over their digital assets.
