# Community Manifesto & Code of Conduct

These documents were drafted during the hic et nunc hicathon and got worked on since then by the Teia community. 
Those are “living documents” that have not been voted on yet and will be subject to changes made by the "core values" working group of the teia community until finalized by an official vote. However they are put in place until consensus is reached as they reflect the current state of the discussion and are the result of a wide and long process with diverse contributors from the community.

# 1. Core Values

## **PREAMBLE**

TEIA is an open, digital platform of ideas and works of creativity. It is an artwork made of artworks; Artists and collectors coming together as equal lovers of creativity in order to emancipate and democratize art.

We want to elevate art, no matter how known or unknown the artist. We want to protect our art. We want to fill the blank canvas that is TEIA.

TEIA is a self sustaining organization managed by the community for the community.

TEIA is built and improved by its participants. We believe that we as a collective can be bigger than the sum of our members. We strive to improve TEIA in a decentralised manner. That means we can build and evolve  everything at once, everything follows chaotic growth. This infinite process might at times look disorganized from the outside looking in, but it isn't: The community organizes itself; chaos creates beauty.

We want, however, to protect and preserve the spirit of Teia. Those core values should guide our decisions moving forward in this rapidly evolving space. This manifesto, collectively written, tries to put this spirit into words.

### **§1 Inclusivity**
- We believe in a community for all users and all art forms.
    - Inclusive for everyone, no matter your race, ethnicity, religion, class, culture, national background and citizenship status, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, or mental or physical disability, neurotype, health related issues, income level, mental health status or trauma
    - Inclusive for all participants, no matter the social/economic status.
    - inclusive for all art forms and mediums including but not limited to: digital, analog, graphics, vr, video, audio, music, fiber, physical and the ones to come.

- 6.1 Things that may look responsible now may be problematic for us and everyone in the future. Lifecycle impacts must be considered.

# 2. **Code of Conduct**
Teia is a community of artists, creators, and collectors from all around the world, who come together to grow and inspire others. All participants in the community are expected to act lawfully, honestly, ethically, and in the best interest of the project.
We want Teia to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. This Code of Conduct offers guidelines designed to keep Teia a respectful, supportive, and open space. Remember, Teia is what you make of it, and as a community we can create a great experience for everyone.

### Contribute and help improve the community.
- Look for ways to contribute and find positive solutions. Stay open minded and empathetic around areas of improvements. And take initiative to help out where you can.
- Try to share your knowledge with the community.
- Your participation matters. If you feel that you or the group you identify with is underrepresented or does not have a voice in the community, know that you are welcome here. Be the first to fill that gap, invite your peers, and make yourself heard.
- Bugs and security flaws in the platform, blockchain or smart contract should be disclosed responsibly, according to regulations and best practices regarding those procedures.
- Respect the community.
    - We may have different values or viewpoints of the world but we have one thing in common: we love art.
    - Be civil and respect each other. Don't harass, impersonate, or belittle others.
    - Don't post spam or vandalize the space.

### Harassment is not tolerated.
We do not condone harassment against any member, for any reason.
Harassment includes
- targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.
- offensive verbal, visual or text based comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, neurotype, health related issues, income level, mental health status, trauma, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion
- deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, sustained disruption of conversation. Harassment of admins or moderators will not be tolerated.
- If you see something wrong, voice it and try to help people without a voice. Report abuse of the platform. [link to report page/channel]

### Copyright and intellectual property
As artists and collectors of art, we want to acknowledge and protect intellectual property as it is crucial for our integrity and work but we also acknowledge that some forms of art need to use the works of others (i.e. remixes, tributes, quotes).
- Artists should avoid uses of existing copyrighted material that do not generate new artistic meaning, being aware that a change of medium, without more, may not meet this standard.
- The use of a preexisting work, whether in part or in whole, should be justified by the artistic objective, and artists who deliberately repurpose copyrighted works should be prepared to explain their rationales both for doing so and for the extent of their uses.
- Artists should avoid suggesting that incorporated elements are original to them, unless that suggestion is integral to the meaning of the new work.
- When copying another’s work, an artist should cite the source, whether in the new work or elsewhere (by means such as labeling or embedding), unless there is an articulable aesthetic basis for not doing so.

*These bulletpoints on itellectual property are taken from page 11 of [https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1000&context=scholcom](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1000&context=scholcom) and reflect our idea of how to handle the topic.*

### Fairplay on the marketplace
- In order to make collecting a good experience for everyone, collectors should voluntarily refrain from using automated tools for collecting, from hindering other participants from collecting and from interfering with the smart contract in any way.
- Collectors should refrain from collecting excessively such as collecting large amounts of a “free” or low priced edition. Participants should apply their discretion as to what counts as “excessive”.



# 3. **Terms and Conditions - Account restrictions**

## **About Copyminting**
Copyminting is the act of taking another's work and minting it as your own. We come down heavily on any account that does this. It results in an instant restriction. Several processes are in place to detect copyminting and other behaviors against the CoC. A copymint team also oversees the processes and acts as moderators over accounts in question.

They operate on the following Terms and work voluntarily to keep TEIA free of copymints and keep collectors and artists happy. Please understand their role and that processes like this do generate mistakes. The team investigates when alerted through the #report-copyminters channel of the [original "hicetnunc" Discord server](https://discord.gg/4CR2X7mh)). Please respect their work, and help them by being courteous and accurate with the information that will help your inquiry.

## **Restricted accounts**
Accounts that TEIA restricts are labeled “restricted account,” and OBJKTs that a restricted account has minted are labeled “restricted OBJKT” in the marketplace.
Various other Tezos marketplaces also use the TEIA restricted list of accounts, which means that once TEIA restricts an account, other NFT marketplaces will likely follow suit.

Since TEIA is a decentralized application, restricted OBJKTs are only superficially restricted, meaning that they are still available through APIs and on-chain data.
Reasons for an account restriction:
- Copymint: minting another artist(s) work without their consent or minting your identical work more than once. Copyminting can also include OBJKTs based on another artist's work, with minimal filters or modifications applied.
- Duplicate mints across marketplaces: if you mint the same work more than once without artistic merit or an apparent reference for prospective buyers.
- Infringed copyright: the use of artists' work in part or whole where the artist explicitly forbids third party use.
- Funding from a confirmed restricted account.
- Funding of confirmed restricted accounts.
- Wash trading: market manipulation through buying own OBJKTs directly or indirectly.
- Minting material that glorifies human rights violations or is soley pornographic without any artistic expression. This applies especially but is not limited to cases of copied or filtered pornographic content stolen from third parties.
- Violates the CoC in other ways: mainly if it is overtly abusive to another group, invokes violence, or intimidates or harasses.

### Procedure if your account has been restricted

Contesting restrictions can be made through the #copymints channel in the TEIA Discord (editors note: the copymint report channel on the Teia community discord server will be set up soon, for now copymint reports should be directed to the #report-copyminters channel of the [original "hicetnunc" Discord server](https://discord.gg/4CR2X7mh)). 

It’s important to notice that errors are possible at this stage, and we apologize for such cases. We ask users to direct such issues exclusively through the channel.

You should not expect a warm reception if you attempt malicious action on the platform or threaten mods and admin. The team has to process many requests, some of which are less than honest.

Unfortunately, they have to begin the process with a lack of trust, and you have to convince them that you are trustworthy. The most straightforward way to overturn a mistaken restriction is to engage with the team politely.

Provide your account address and the reason for the dispute. Be prepared to show works in progress or versions of a work in question so the team can verify and determine if the restriction is mistaken. Having a well-used Twitter account, work is shown on your website, Instagram, Flickr, Tumblr, etc., that is your own will help.

If the copymint team agrees that the account does not violate the TEIA CoC, the account affected will be removed from the TEIA restricted list. It takes about 5 mins for any changes to the restricted list to go live.
