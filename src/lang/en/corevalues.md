### TEIA's Core Values

TEIA is an open, digital platform of ideas and works of creativity. It is an artwork made of artworks; Artists and collectors coming together as equal lovers of creativity in order to emancipate and democratize art.

We want to elevate art, no matter how known or unknown the artist. We want to protect our art. We want to fill the blank canvas that is TEIA.

TEIA is a self sustaining organization managed by the community for the community.

TEIA is built and improved by its participants. We believe that we as a collective can be bigger than the sum of our members. We strive to improve TEIA in a decentralised manner. That means we can build and evolve everything at once, everything follows chaotic growth. This infinite process might at times look disorganized from the outside looking in, but it isn't: The community organizes itself; chaos creates beauty.

We want, however, to protect and preserve the spirit of Teia. Those core values should guide our decisions moving forward in this rapidly evolving space. This manifesto, collectively written, tries to put this spirit into words.

## **§4 Decentralization** 

We believe in shared ownership on the platform, no one should have exclusive rights over others.

4.1 We believe in a platform that radically dismantles and democratizes the established art market and methods of distribution.

4.2 Teia should remain open source. We aim to create open solutions and look for ways to limit gatekeeping and share knowledge wherever possible.

4.3 We want to build a transparent platform that facilitates a rich ecosystem and integrates with the world around it. We encourage third party additions/tools for the Teia core as long they stay true to the spirit of Teia.

4.4 We want to build a platform where important decisions are voted on in an open and fair process before being implemented. We want to:

4.4.1 Encourage and secure open and free discussions around community voting.  
4.4.2 Give all users fair rights in this voting process.  
4.4.3 Encourage and help all members to participate in community votes.

4.5 The community should respect and encourage all opinions, even if they are against the consensus. The individual should respect consensus reached by the community in the same way.

## **§5 Simplicity and Accessibility**

5.1 Teia should aim to be as accessible as possible. The creation of an account should be simple and fast and possible anonymously and without providing any personal information.

5.3 We want to provide a simple and easy-to-use platform for all users, including those with accessibility needs.

5.5 We believe in providing access to useful tools for all members of the community.

## **§6 Sustainability**

We believe in sustainability. With technology evolving, we as a community need to evolve too and build towards a more viable future. We shall be mindful of the consequences of our actions and evaluate our decisions with that in mind, always pursuing the least destructive path.  
 
6.1 Things that may look responsible now may be problematic for us and everyone in the future. Lifecycle impacts must be considered.

6.2 With that in mind, we should always be open to the possibility of changing the technological foundations of Teia in order to ensure it stays sustainable, transparent and accessible to everyone.

6.3: Teia should find decentralised and long-lasting solutions for storing files associated with Tokens minted on Teia. The files need to always be accessible to the public no matter the future state of the platform.

7.3 We believe in providing an open and supportive space for all artists and collectors to express themselves freely and without limitations.
