# TEIA's Core Values

TEIA is an open, digital platform of ideas and works of creativity. It is an artwork made of artworks; Artists and collectors coming together as equal lovers of creativity in order to emancipate and democratize art.

We want to elevate art, no matter how known or unknown the artist. We want to protect our art. We want to fill the blank canvas that is TEIA.

TEIA is a self sustaining organization managed by the community for the community.

TEIA is built and improved by its participants. We believe that we as a collective can be bigger than the sum of our members. We strive to improve TEIA in a decentralised manner. That means we can build and evolve everything at once, everything follows chaotic growth. This infinite process might at times look disorganized from the outside looking in, but it isn't: The community organizes itself; chaos creates beauty.

We want, however, to protect and preserve the spirit of Teia. Those core values should guide our decisions moving forward in this rapidly evolving space. This manifesto, collectively written, tries to put this spirit into words.

## 1. **Inclusivity** 

### 1.1. We believe in a community for all users and all art forms: 

- Inclusive for everyone, no matter your race, ethnicity, religion, class, culture, national background and citizenship status, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, or mental or physical disability, neurotype, health related issues, income level, mental health status or trauma  
- Inclusive for all participants, no matter the social/economic status.  
- inclusive for all art forms and mediums including but not limited to: digital, analog, graphics, vr, video, audio, music, fiber, physical and the ones to come. 

We want to reach a parity in voice and contribution between people from all communities and sorts of privileges and locations. This needs to be reached through concrete action and leveraging power.

## 2. **Respect** 

We believe in a community that respects one another’s dignity, ideas, thoughts and art.

We respect our community and value each person's contribution.

We understand that this is, and always will be, a work in progress and we are empathetic and patient with this process.

## 3. **Community/Solidarity**

We are an egalitarian community. Our community is not about rank, status, or popularity. It’s about contributing, building together, fostering connections, encouraging community interactions, providing support, and growing together.   
      
The community must ensure the freedom of the individual, but this freedom ends where it endangers the well-being of the community.

We want to:

- Avoid displaying indications of rank, status, or popularity but are open to celebrating contributions of time and skill.  
- Build what benefits the whole community, not just a select few with the exception of accessibility features that enable underserved members.  
- Create systems that are inclusive to the community as a whole.   
- Avoid systems that could be exclusive in any shape or form.   
- Protect the community and their intellectual property from threats.

## 4. **Decentralization** 

- We believe in shared ownership on the platform, no one should have exclusive rights over others.
- We believe in a platform that radically dismantles and democratizes the established art market and methods of distribution.
- Teia should remain open source. We aim to create open solutions and look for ways to limit gatekeeping and share knowledge wherever possible.
- We want to build a transparent platform that facilitates a rich ecosystem and integrates with the world around it. We encourage third party additions/tools for the Teia core as long they stay true to the spirit of Teia.
- We want to build a platform where important decisions are voted on in an open and fair process before being implemented. We want to:
  - Encourage and secure open and free discussions around community voting.  
  - Give all users fair rights in this voting process.  
  - Encourage and help all members to participate in community votes.
- The community should respect and encourage all opinions, even if they are against the consensus. The individual should respect consensus reached by the community in the same way.

---

## 5. **Simplicity and Accessibility**

- Teia should aim to be as accessible as possible. The creation of an account should be simple and fast and possible anonymously and without providing any personal information.
- Teia should not store or collect personal information about its members beyond their tezos addresses and user name and optional linked accounts.
- We want to provide a simple and easy-to-use platform for all users, including those with accessibility needs.
- We want to help those without access to the platform to get the ability to participate. (i.e. via donations for people who can’t afford to mint)
- We believe in providing access to useful tools for all members of the community.

## 6. **Sustainability**

We believe in sustainability. With technology evolving, we as a community need to evolve too and build towards a more viable future. We shall be mindful of the consequences of our actions and evaluate our decisions with that in mind, always pursuing the least destructive path.  
 
Things that may look responsible now may be problematic for us and everyone in the future. Lifecycle impacts must be considered.

With that in mind, we should always be open to the possibility of changing the technological foundations of Teia in order to ensure it stays sustainable, transparent and accessible to everyone.

Teia should find decentralised and long-lasting solutions for storing files associated with Tokens minted on Teia. The files need to always be accessible to the public no matter the future state of the platform.

## 7. **Creativity** 

Creativity has no borders. We want to encourage and organize events that bring the global community together and create bonds and collaborations between us and contribute to shaping the future of art as whole.

We want to encourage and help the development of new forms and shapes of art through collaborations between the users.

We believe in providing an open and supportive space for all artists and collectors to express themselves freely and without limitations.

Creativity needs freedom, we want to make sure there are as few restrictions as possible in place to make Teia a place of creativity without limitations but also ensuring the intellectual rights of creators/artists and complying with legal requirements as well as the wellbeing of Teia's communiity.
