  <br />
  <p><em><strong>Copyminting</strong> is the act of taking another's work and minting it as your own. It also includes the act of minting the same work twice, either on the same or separate platforms/blockchains. Your account will get restricted if you do this.</em></p>
  <br />
  <p><strong>Please note that minting the same media file twice, even accidentally, may lead to an account restriction! If you made a mistake and want to re-mint your OBJKT, make sure to burn the old one first!</strong> <a href="https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/How-to-burn-%F0%9F%94%A5">(How to burn)</a></p>

  <div class="markdown-heading">
    <h2 class="heading-element">Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Minting is the operation of creating an NFT - at this point, you define the quantity of the NFT and information about it such as title and description. Once created, you will choose the number you want to make available and a price - this is a Swap operation.</p>
  <br />
  <p>It might be useful to prepare a text file with all the information you will need for minting - if the minting operation is interrupted, you might lose what you typed in. OGs know from experience how frustrating it can be, especially if you wrote a classy and long description without saving a copy.</p>
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>You should have already created a wallet (we recommend <a href="https://templewallet.com/" rel="nofollow">Temple</a> or <a href="https://wallet.kukai.app/" rel="nofollow">Kukai</a>). The wallet needs to have enough funds to mint. Click on “Sync". Your browser will show a pop-up asking you to sync with your wallet.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A checkbox for "Monospace Font Required."</li>
        <li>There is a text area labeled "Typed Art Input." Depending on the monospace font required checkbox value, the text area renders the monospace (Iosevka font) or non-monospace (Source Sans Pro font).</li>

  <p>Source Sans Pro was selected for text mints as it's the default font (non-mono) on Objkt.com. This ensures text is encoded correctly and displayed as intended on Objkt.com and Teia.art.

  <p>Profile information is useful in a number of ways. Most importantly, it can identify you to your potential collectors. Your profile details are saved with the Subjkt contract. The Profile page is where you update these, and it also links to the tzprofiles site so you can add that information.</p>
  <br />
  <p>To edit your profile, make sure you've synced your wallet with Teia. Click the menu icon or go to: <a href="https://www.teia.art/subjkt" rel="nofollow">https://www.teia.art/subjkt</a></p>

  <p>Add a username, description, and choose an image for your profile pic. The profile pic may take a few moments to show up. Because it shows with a circular crop, you may have to adjust your initial picture and add it again.</p>

<div class="markdown-body">
  <br />
  <h1>How to Swap 🔃</h1>
  <br />
  <p>1: <em>(noun)</em> an act, instance, or process of exchanging one thing for another</p>
  <p>2: <em>(verb)</em> to set a price for your OBJKT</p>
  <br />
  <p>If you have just minted some OBJKTs or you have unsold OBJKTs, it's time to Swap them - that means pricing some or all, for collectors to buy.</p>
  <br />            
  <p><strong>Note</strong> - you can't swap OBJKTs that are already swapped, have already been collected, or if you don't have enough tez to pay the fees. You won't see Swap, Burn, Transfer options or be able to cancel swaps if you haven't synced the account that owns them.</p>
  <br />
  <p>You don't need to swap all of the OBJKTs you own. Many artists like to keep one or two, either as 'artist proofs' or for gifting etc.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Pricing is a tricky area that can be based on how big the edition size is, how well known and liked you are for your artwork, and how well you market it. Another consideration is how much <em>you</em> want for the work, not considering collectors and the current market. Pricing consistently and with some thought will influence some collectors.</p>
  <br />
  <p>If you're considering pricing very low (0.01 tez, for example) or free, consider the fact that bots or bottom-dwelling flippers may buy many (sometimes all). When collectors view the OBJKT history, they will see the churn of low price activity that such flippers create, and it can reflect badly on how responsible collectors will view both the work and you as an artist. You can give away manually or try to regulate flipper action by swapping in blocks at different times (this also helps collectors in different time zones).</p>
  <br />
  <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Click on your OBJKT's link to see the details. If you are synced to your wallet, you should see the "Swap" option next to History. (If you don’t see these options, then you have to sync your wallet again.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click on Swap.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Input how many OBJKTs out of your edition that you want to set for sale. For example, if you have <code>10</code> and you want to keep <code>1</code> and sell <code>9</code>, then input <code>9</code>. If you want to sell all of them, input <code>10</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Input how much each edition should cost in Tezos.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click the "swap" button. You will be prompted to approve the transaction in your wallet app.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The user interface will update you on the transaction, or you can check in your wallet (look at 'activity' in Temple wallet). Once the transaction approves, your OBJKT/s are for sale to collectors. Go out and tell the Twitter world...</p>

  <br />
  <p>1: <em>(verb)</em> to "delete" your OBJKT</p>
  <br />
  <p>Transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, so you can't "delete" them. The "burn" button sends the OBJKT to the <a href="https://tzkt.io/tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX/operations/" rel="nofollow">burn address</a> - tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX, or you can send it yourself using your wallet app. The burn address is an open address that nobody owns a key to, so objkts are never retrievable.</p>
  <p>If you are burning the objkt because you made a mistake and want to remint it, make sure there are no other owners - you can only burn those you own, so you will need to ask those collectors to burn those objkts before you can remint.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>To Burn an OBJKT:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Make sure your wallet app is synced with Teia.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Make sure you cancel the swap of the OBJKT so it can be available in your wallet when you are ready to burn it. The user interface will show you how many you have available for burning. Think very hard about how many you'll burn - you can't undo this.</p>
      <br />
      <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6487972/227187937-600b66ec-627b-428f-8e47-cd8f1926c385.jpg" alt="burn screen"></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Press the burn button. Your wallet app will prompt you to confirm the transaction. Once the transaction completes, your wallet app will show the OBJKT as transferred to the burn address.

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>If you burn all of the objkts that were minted, the objkt will disappear from your profile. If someone buys one of your editions, even if you burn the rest of them, the OBJKT won't disappear from your profile.</em></p>

  <h2>How to Sell an OBJKT Created by Another Artist</h2>
  <p>If you've collected another artist's OBJKT, then you own the right to resell it. This is also referred to as placing your OBJKT on the secondary market. It's much the same as swapping one of your own creations, although a royalty will be paid to the artist.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Make sure your wallet is synced.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click on "swap" and set a price for your OBJKT. Remember - if there are royalties, that percentage will go to the artist, so consider that in the pricing.</p>

            answer={`
<div class="markdown-body">
  <br />
  <h2>TEIA's Copyright Features©️</h2>
  <p>TEIA empowers artists to attach copy and usage rights clauses to each minted OBJKT (NFT). These clauses are determined and declared by the artist at the time of minting. If you are interested in using this feature, it is essential to carefully read and understand the descriptions, explanations, and implications of each option before proceeding.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The primary purpose of this feature is to enable artists to sell usage rights for their works in a transparent, legal, and fair manner. The blockchain facilitates this process by providing clear, objective, and easily traceable documentation of the agreement and the involved parties.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Collectors may acquire these rights for purposes such as broadcasting, reproduction, merchandise sales, soundtracks, game assets, etc. TEIA DAO acts as a neutral platform that facilitates these agreements but does not intervene in or enforce the terms of the agreements. Please note that support for these clauses may vary across platforms, as the data is minted on-chain but not all platforms may choose to display or honor it.</p>
  <br />
  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> TEIA is not a legal entity, organization, or institution with the authority to enforce laws or resolve disputes. The agreements attached to each mint (NFT) constitute a direct contractual relationship between the artist (licensor) and the collector (licensee). The terms of these agreements are determined at the time of minting and must be resolved through mutually agreed-upon means in the event of a dispute. Both parties are responsible for conclusively proving ownership of the relevant wallet(s) if required.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Sync Your Wallet:</strong> Ensure your wallet is synced with TEIA and that it is the correct wallet address you wish to associate with the agreements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Navigate to "Mint":</strong> Go to the "Mint" section to begin creating your OBJKT.</p>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Select "Custom License":</strong> Fill in the required details for your OBJKT, then choose "Custom License" from the License menu.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Define Your Terms:</strong> Review the available options for copyright clauses and permissions. Each option includes detailed explanations—read them thoroughly to select the agreement that best suits your work. If additional details or modifications are needed, use the Addendum section to customize the agreement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Mint Your OBJKT:</strong> Once the terms are finalized, proceed to mint your OBJKT as usual.</p>
